An assignment of translating an assignment(I designated Assignment 2 which uses four sorts) into another language and comparing execution times.

How to use me(Requires BASH):
1. clone from the repo
2. if you have Bash terminal execute: bash benchmark.bash
3. results will be produced on console and saved to result.txt


Python: the original source code language of our assignment, benchmarking at about 8 seconds of cpu time.

Swift: I picked swift for the second language mostly out of random using a random language picker, I was simultaneously curious of Apple's claim to fame language since I own a macbook.

Disclaimer: I am not bashing Swift or Apple, this is a test of translation, and it may be unoptimized in Swift form
