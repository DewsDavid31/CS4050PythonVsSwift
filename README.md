An assignment of translating an assignment(I designated Assignment 2 which uses four sorts) into another language and comparing execution times.

Python: the original source code language of our assignment, benchmarking at about 8 seconds of cpu time.

Swift: I picked swift for the second language mostly out of random using a random language picker, I was simultaneously curious of Apple's claim to fame language since I own a macbook.
